Notes:

To install the MQTT Sync steps and elements, you will need to copy all the files from the Executable folder into your ...\Documents\SimioUserExtensions folder.  Also, make sure you unblock the files (Right Click, Properties, Unblock).

To run the example models, you need Simio 14.237 or higher.   These models have been updated to use the newly added JSON and String functions receintly added to Simio.
